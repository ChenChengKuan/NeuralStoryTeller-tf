# NeuralStoryTeller-tf

This project aims to reproduce the awesome work [Neural Story Teller](https://github.com/ryankiros/neural-storyteller). Since the original work by Kiros was written in Theano which won't be mainted in the future. This project attempts to borrow the ideas from the original work and replace them with tensorflow. This repo is still an ongoing work but can be used to generate simple result.

# Background

Kiros and Samin had provided great explanations of how Neural Story Teller work. Please refer to original [repo](https://github.com/ryankiros/neural-storyteller) and Samin's [blog post](https://medium.com/@samim/generating-stories-about-images-d163ba41e4ed)  I just give a wrap-up here:
